# The Random File Repository
This repo is designed only for the storage of files, almost like an alternative to Pastebin. Anyone can add files, but they can only modify/delete their files.
> ### Pro tip!
> Don't copy the direct URL of a file from your URL bar. Instead, click the `Raw` button next to the `Blame` and `Edit` buttons. Then, you can copy the URL from your URL bar. 

I do already have a [random image repo](https://github.com/ReallyBadDeveloper/random-image-repo), but this is for multi-purpose files that don't need an individual repository (e.g. 3D models, text files).
